Iteration Planning
==================

The purpose of the iteration planning meeting is for the team
to commit to the completion of a set of the highest-ranked
"product backlog items" for the next iteration. This commitment
define the iteration backlog and is based on the team's velocity
or capacity and the length of the iteration timebox.

The output of the iteration planning is:

    - The iteration backlog, consisting of the stories committed
      to the iteration, with acceptance criteria where appropriate.
    - A statement of iteration goals, typically a sentence or two
      stating the business objectives of the iteration
    - A commitment by the team to the work needed to achieve the goals

Who is Involved?
================

    - Scrum Master: Facilitates the meeting
    - Product Owner: Represents the details of the PBIs and their
      acceptance criteria.
    - Delivery Team: Define the tasks and effort necessary to fulfill
      the commitment.

Before the Planning meeting
===========================

Before getting started, ensure:

    - The items in the product backlog have been sized by the team
      and assigned a relative story point value.
    - The product backlog is stack ranked to reflect the priorities
      of the Product Owner.
    - There is a general understanding of the acceptance criteria for
      these ranked backlog items.

  * Equal Opportunity backlog

    The product backlog addresses new functionality and fixes to existing functionality.

    For the purpose of iteration planning, the important characteristics for a product backlog item are:
        - It is small enough to be completed in the iteration
        - We can verify it has been implemented correctly

  * Right-Sized Backlog Items
    Product backlog items too large to be completed in an iteration need
    to be split into smaller pieces. The best way to split product backlog
    items is by value, not by process.

    If we can split a product backlog item so that its children deliver value,
    then our iterations incrementally deliver value. If we split by process,
    then we impact time-to-market because value is not delivered until all the
    children are complete.

Planning Process
================

Planning the contents of an iteration has two stages:
    - determining how many user stories can fit into the iteration, then
    - breaking those stories down into tasks and assigning owners.

...


  User Story Size
  ===============

  Mature teams use past velocity to determine what product backlog items
  to commit to during the iteration. Velocity is the average number of user
  story points a team can complete in an iteration. For example, a new team
  completed 12, 14, and 8 points in their last three iterations. Review meetings
  revealed that the team was only able to complete 8 story points in the most
  recent iteration, due to a technical issue that has since been solved. Based
  on these factors, the team would estimate they have a velocity of 12 story
  points, to use in the next iteration.

  Task Capacity
  =============

  The capacity for the team is derived from three simple measures for each team member:

      - Number of ideal hours in the work day
      - Days in the iteration that the person will be available
      - Percentage of time the person will dedicate to this team

  For example, let's look at a team of five individuals, all committed to the
  team full-time. Each has about six ideal hours per day to work on tasks, and no
  one is taking vacation. For a week-long iteration:

      5 team members X 6 ideal hours X 5 working days = 150 hours of task capacity

  Planning Steps
  ==============

      1. The Product Owner describes the highest ranked product backlog item.
      2. The team determines the tasks necessary to complete each
          product backlog item.
      3. Team members volunteer to own the tasks.
      4. Task owners estimate the ideal hours they need to finish each task.
      5. Planning steps repeat while the team can commit to delivery without
          exceeding optimum velocity.

  If any individual exceeds their capacity during iteration planning, then the
  team collaborates to distribute the load.
