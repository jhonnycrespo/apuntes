RELATIONSHIP TYPES
===================
  * One-to-one
    - both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship.
    - Each primary key value relates to only one (or none) record in the related table.
    - ejm: you may or may not be married.
    - most one to one relationships are forced by business rules and don't flow naturally from the data.
      in the absence of such rule, you can usually combine both tables into one without breaking any
      normalization rules.

  * One-to-many
    - the primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one or many records in the related table
    - ejm: you only have one mother, but your mother may have several children.

  * many-to-many
    - each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table.
    - many to many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational
      systems can't directly accommodate the relationship.
    - ejm: if you have several siblings, so do your siblings (have many siblings)

  * Self referencing relationships
    - This is used when a table needs to have a relationship with itself
