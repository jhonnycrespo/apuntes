COLLATE
=======



A character set is a set of symbols and encodings. A collation is a set of rules for comparing 
characters in a character set. Let's make the distinction clear with an example of an imaginary character set.

Suppose that we have an alphabet with four letters: 'A', 'B', 'a', 'b'. We give each letter a number: 
'A' = 0, 'B' = 1, 'a' = 2, 'b' = 3. The letter 'A' is a symbol, the number 0 is the encoding for 'A', and 
the combination of all four letters and their encodings is a character set.

Now, suppose that we want to compare two string values, 'A' and 'B'. The simplest way to do this is to 
look at the encodings: 0 for 'A' and 1 for 'B'. Because 0 is less than 1, we say 'A' is less than 'B'. 
Now, what we've just done is apply a collation to our character set. The collation is a set of 
rules (only one rule in this case): "compare the encodings." We call this simplest of all possible collations 
a binary collation.



======================


A character encoding is a way to encode characters so that they fit in memory. That is, if the charset is 
ISO-8859-15, the euro symbol, �, will be encoded as 0xa4, and in UTF-8, it will be 0xe282ac.

The collation is how to compare characters, in latin9, there are letters as e � � � f, if sorted by their 
binary representation, it will go e f � � � but if the collation is set to, for example, french, you'll have 
them in the order you thought they would be, which is all of e � � � are equal, and then f.


Which Collation should I use?
