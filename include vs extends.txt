DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INCLUDE AND EXTEND
======================================
	- Extend is used when a use case adds steps to another first class use case.
	- Ejm: imagine "withdraw cash"  is a use case for an ATM machine


	- Include is used to extract use case fragments that are duplicated in multiple use cases.
	- The included use case cannot stand aline and the original use case is not complete without the included one.
	- Ejm: the flow of events that occurs at the beginning of every ATM use case (when the user puts in their ATM card,
	  enters their PIN, and is shown the main menu) would be a good candidate for an include.

	- ejm: use case: i am going to the city
		includes -> drive the car
		extends -> fill the petrol
