Continuous Delivery
===================

You practice continuous delivery when your codebase is always deployable, ready 
to go to production in one click. While it is recommended to deploy to production 
as soon as you get a green build, you may decide to slow down the releases on 
purpose for business reasons.

Continuous Deployment
=====================

Continuous deployment happens when every change to the main branch that passes the 
CI tests gets pushed to production without the need for human interaction. This often 
results in many deployments per day which provide fast feedback to the development team.
