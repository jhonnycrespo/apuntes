Continuous Integration (CI)
===========================

La integracion continua es el proceso de automatizar la compilacion y el testeo
del codigo cada vez que un miembro del equipo confirma cambios en el control de
versiones.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers 
to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in 
is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

By integrating regularly, you can detect errors quickly, and locate them more easily.

Because you’re integrating so frequently, there is significantly less back-tracking
to discover where things went wrong, so you can spend more time building features.





Continuous integration is the practice of routinely integrating code changes into 
the main branch of a repository, and testing the changes, as early and often as 
possible. Ideally, developers will integrate their code daily, if not multiple 
times a day.


Benefits of continuous integration
==================================

Investing in CI results in fast feedback on code changes. Fast as in "within minutes" 
fast. A team that relies primarily on manual testing may get feedback in a couple hours, 
but in reality, comprehensive test feedback comes a day–or several days–after the code 
gets changed. And by that time more changes have occurred, making bug-fixing an 
archeological expedition with developers digging through several layers of code to 
get at the root of the problem.

Martin Fowler:

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team 
integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least 
daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by 
an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as 
possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration 
problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.
