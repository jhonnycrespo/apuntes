BlockingQueue
==============
   - The BlockingQueue interface in the java.util.concurrent package represents a queue which is "thread safe" 
     to put into, and take instances from.

Usage
=====
   - A BlockingQueue is typically used to have on thread produce objects, which another thread consumes.
   - The producing thread will keep producing new objects and insert the into the queue, until the queue
     reaches some upper bound on what it can contain. its limit, in other words.
   - If the blocking queue reaches its upper limit, the producing thread is blocked while trying to insert the new object.
     it remains blocked until a consuming thread takes an object out of the queue.

  - The consuming thread keeps taking objects out of the blocking queue, and process them. if the consuming
    thread tries to take an objects out of an empty queue, the consuming thread is blocked until a producing
    thread puts an object into the queue.
