   - The Object class in java contains three final methods that allows threads to communicate about the lock
     status of a resource. These methods are wait(), notify() and notifyAll().

   - The current thread which invokes these methods on any object should have the "object monitor" else it
     throws java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException exception.

   - The wait() and notify() methods must be called within a "synchronized" context.

wait
====
   - wait() tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other thread
     enters the same monitor and calls notify().


notify
=======

   - notify() wakes up the first thread that called wait() on the same object.

   - If there is no thread which is waiting, using Object.wait() , any calls to Object.notify() or 
     Object.notifyAll() have no effect



Observations
==============
   - wait and notify is low level...you should use another high level class.
