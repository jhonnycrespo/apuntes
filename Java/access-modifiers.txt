ACCESS MODIFIERS
=================

Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods, and constructors.

There are two types of modifiers in java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.

The access modifiers in java specifies accessibility (scope) of a data member, method, constructor or class.

There are 4 types of java access modifiers:

    1. private (Visible to the class only)
    2. default (Visible to the package)
    3. protected (Visible to the package and all subclasses)
    4. public (Visible to the world)

There are many non-access modifiers such as static, abstract, synchronized, native, volatile, transient etc. Here, we will learn access modifiers.


PRIVATE
========

The private access modifier is accessible only within class.


DEFAULT
=======

If you don't use any modifier, it is treated as "default" bydefault. The default modifier is accessible only within package.


PROTECTED
==========

The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but through inheritance only.


PUBLIC
=======

The public access modifier is accessible everywhere. It has the widest scope among all other modifiers.
