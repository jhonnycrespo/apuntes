keyword
=======
   - The synchronized keyword is all about different threads reading and writing to the same variables, 
     objects and resources. This is not a trivial topic in Java, but here is a quote from Sun:

	- Synchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference and memory consistency 
          errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread, all reads or writes to that object's variables 
          are done through synchronized methods.

   - basically this Synchronized keyword makes your methods or code thread-safe


example
=======
   - In a very, very small nutshell: When you have two threads that are reading and writing to the same 
     'resource', say a variable named foo, you need to ensure that these threads access the variable in 
     an atomic way. Without the synchronized keyword, your thread 1 may not see the change thread 2 made to foo, 
     or worse, it may only be half changed. This would not be what you logically expect.
