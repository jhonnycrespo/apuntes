Node
====

Base class for scene graph nodes. A scene graph is a set of tree data structures where every item has zero or one parent, and each item is either a "leaf" with zero sub-items or a "branch" with zero or more sub-items.

Each item in the scene graph is called a Node. Branch nodes are of type Parent, whose concrete subclasses are Group, Region, and Control, or subclasses thereof.

Leaf nodes are classes such as Rectangle, Text, ImageView, MediaView, or other such leaf classes which cannot have children. Only a single node within each scene graph tree will have no parent, which is referred to as the "root" node.
