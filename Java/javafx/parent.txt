Parent
=======

The base class for all nodes that have children in the scene graph.

This class handles all hierarchical scene graph operations, including adding/removing child nodes, marking branches dirty for layout and rendering, picking, bounds calculations, and executing the layout pass on each pulse.

There are two direct concrete Parent subclasses

    Group effects and transforms to be applied to a collection of child nodes.
    Region class for nodes that can be styled with CSS and layout children.
