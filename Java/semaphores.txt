Class Semaphore
================

   - A Semaphore is a thread synchronization tool that can be used either to send signals between threads to avoid
     missed signals, or to guard a critical section like you would do with a lock.


Parameters
===========
   - int permits: the number of permits
   - boolean fair: Creates a Semaphore with the given fairness setting.

Methods
========
   - acquire(): Acquires a permit from the semaphore, blocking until one is available, or the thread is interrupted.
   - release(): Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore. 





example
=======
   - There are a dedicated number of people that are allowed in the club at once. If the club is full no one is allowed 
     to enter, but as soon as one person leaves another person might enter.

   - It's simply a way to limit the number of consumers for a specific resource. For example, to limit the number 
     of simultaneous calls to a database in an application.
