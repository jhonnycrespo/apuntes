 - a closure is any function that somehow remains available after the functions that surrounded it have returned.

 - closure is when a function remembers its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope


ejm: 

function foo() {
  var bar = 'bar';

  function baz() {
    console.log(bar);
  }

  bam(baz);

}

function bam(baz) {
  baz();
}

foo();
