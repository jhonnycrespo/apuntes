BUILD PLUGINS
=============
Build plugins will be executed during the build and they should be configured in the <build/> element from the POM.

REPORTING PLUGINS
=================
Reporting plugins will be executed during the site generation and they should be configured in the <reporting/> element from the POM. Because the result of a Reporting plugin is part of the generated site, Reporting plugins should be both internationalized and localized.

A goal is a "unit of work" in maven.

Maven consists of several core plugins:
    - JAR plugin: create the jar file

    goals:
        - compile: is bound to the compile phase and is used to compile source files
