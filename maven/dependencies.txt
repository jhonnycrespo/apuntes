maven provides support internal and external dependencies.

if the scope tag is not included, the default is the "compile" phase.

When you add dependencies you can add the "scope" tag to indicate which lifecycle phase uses this component.

The <Test></Test> scope tag is used for the junit dependency.

Other scopes include <compile, provided, runtime and system>
    - compile is the default scope
    - provided: is used when the jdk is expected to provide them
    - runtime: is required for executing and testing, no compiling.
    - test: is not required for the normal operation of the application
    - system: similar to provided
