   - Three special keywords self, parent and static are used to access properties or methods from "inside" the class definition. 





self
=====
   - permite acceder a una variable estatica en la misma clase.
   - permite acceder a una constane en la misma clase.

parent
=======
   - permite acceder a una variable estatica de una clase padre, desde una clase hija.

static
======
   - Declaring class properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class. 
     A property declared as static cannot be accessed with an instantiated class object (though a static method can). 

   - Because static methods are callable without an instance of the object created, the pseudo-variable $this is not available 
     inside the method declared as static. 

   - static variables and methods are accessed using double semicolons "::"

   - static variable value can change.

   - static variables are on the class scope.
