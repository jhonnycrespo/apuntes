autoload
=========

 - PHP5 introduced the magic function __autoload() which is automatically called when your code references
   a class or interface that hasn't been loaded yet.

 - Every time you want to use a new class, first you need to include this class (using include o require). however if you have
   __autoload function defined, inclusion will handle itself.

 - In short, it just allows you to define search paths for classes so you wouldn't be required to 
   include the files containing them manually.


spl_autoload_register()
=======================
 - PHP 5.12 introduced spl_autoload() which allows you to register multiple autoloader functions, and in the future
   __autoload() will be deprecated.

 - The introduction of spl_autoload_register() gave programmers the ability to create an autoload chain
