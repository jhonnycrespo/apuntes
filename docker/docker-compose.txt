COMPOSE
=======

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With compose, you use a compose file
to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configurations.

Using compose is basically a three-step process.

  1. Define your app's environment with a "Dockerfile" so it can be reproduced anywhere.
  2. Define the service's that make up your app in "docker-compose.yml" so the can be run together in a isolated environment.
  3. Lastly, run "docker-compose up" and Compose will start and run your entire app.
