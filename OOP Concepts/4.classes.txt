Class
=====

In OOP, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects,
providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of 
behavior (member functions or methods).

State of a class
================

The state of an object encompasses all of the (usually static) properties of the object 
plus the current (usually dynamic) values of each of these properties. By properties, we mean 
the totality of the object's attributes and relationships with other objects.
