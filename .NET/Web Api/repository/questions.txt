Repository Pattern is an abstraction layer you put on your Data Access Layer. You data access layer
can be anything from pure ADO.NET stored procedures, Entity Framework or an XML file.

In large systems, where you have data coming from different sources (database/XML/web service), 
it is good to have an abstraction layer. The Repository pattern works well in this scenario.
