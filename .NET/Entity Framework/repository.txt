Encapsulate EF?? -> Repositories


* Return IQueryables or IEnumerables?
- It depends. 

    - IEnumerable: Preferable return IEnumerable
        - Can return millions of records. How to deal with this situation? The repository can help.

    - IQueryable:
        - The caller can refine the query however they want (using Linq or EF if it is referenced). In small applications
        it may work.

        - But in Enterprise application is not convenient.
