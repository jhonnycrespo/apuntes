Factory Design Pattern falls under the category of "creational design pattern".

It deals with the problem of creating objects (products) without specifying the exact class
of object that will be created. The essence of this pattern is to "Define an interface for
creating an object, but let the classes that implement the interface decide which class
to instantiate. The factory method lets a class defer instantiation to sub classes."

Where to Use?
==============

It would be tedious when the client needs to specify the class name while creating the objects. 
So, to resolve this problem, we can use Factory pattern. It provides the client a simple way to create the object.
