LayoutInflater
==============
   - Instantiates a layout XML file into its corresponding View objects.

   - It is never used directly. Instead, use getLayoutInflater() or getSystemService(Class) to retrieve a 
     standard LayoutInflater instance that is already hooked up to the current context and correctly configured 
     for the device you are running on.


Methods
========
   * inflate(int resource, ViewGroup root)
   - Inflate a new view hierarchy from the specified xml resource.

   * from(Context context)
   - Obtains the LayoutInflater from the given context.

   * getContext()
   - Return the context we are running in, for access to resources, class loader, etc.
