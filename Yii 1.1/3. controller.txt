Controller
===========
   - A controller is an instance of CController or of a class that extends CController. 
     It is created by the application object when the user requests it.



   - A controller has a default action. When the user request does not specify which action to execute, 
     the default action will be executed. By default, the default action is named as index. It can be changed by setting 
     the public instance variable, CController::defaultAction.
