Components
==========
   - Components acts as service locators that host a specific set of application components that provide different services
     for the processing of requests. Each component in Yii2 can be accessed using the following syntax:

	Yii::$app->componentID

	ejm:
	Yii::$app->db

Objects
=======
   - almost every class that doesn't extend from the Component class extends from the Object class.
   - The Object class is the base class that implements the property feature.
