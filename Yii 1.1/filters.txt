filter
=======
   - a filter in Yii is a bit of code that is configured to be executed either before or after a controller action
     is executed.

	- ejm: one commong example is if we want to ensure a user is logged in prior to executing a controller action
          method, then we could write a simple access filter that would check this requirement before the action is
	  executed.

   - a filter can be defined as a controller class method or it can be a separate class.
   - when using the simple method approach, the method name must begin with word "filter".
   - the other approach is to write a separate class to perform the filter logic. when using the separate class
     approach, the class must extend "CFilter"
