application
============

   - The application object encapsulates the execution context within which a request is processed. 
     Its main task is to collect some basic information about the request, and dispatch it to an appropriate 
     controller for further processing.

   - The application object is instantiated as a singleton by the entry script. The application singleton can be accessed 
     at any place via Yii::app().


application configuration
===========================

   - 

   protected/config/main.php


   - To apply the configuration, we pass the configuration file name as a parameter to the application's constructor, 
     or to Yii::createWebApplication() in the following manner, usually in the entry script:

	> $app=Yii::createWebApplication($configFile);


application base directory
===========================
   - The application base directory is the root directory under which all security-sensitive PHP scripts and data reside. 

   - By default, it is a subdirectory named protected that is located under the directory containing the entry script. 
     It can be customized by setting the basePath property in the application configuration.


Applications Components
=========================

   - To access an application component, use Yii::app()->ComponentID, where ComponentID refers to the ID of the component 
     (e.g. Yii::app()->cache).
