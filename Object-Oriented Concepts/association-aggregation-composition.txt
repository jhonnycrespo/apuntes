ASSOCIATION 
===========

Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let's
take an example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and
single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects
and both have their own lifecycle. Both can create and delete independently.


AGGREGATION 
===========

Aggregation is a specialize form of Association where all object have their own lifecycle but there
is ownership and child object can not belongs to another parent object. Let's take an example of
Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belongs to multiple departments, but if we delete
the department teacher object will not destroy. We can think about "has-a" relationship.

COMPOSITION 
===========

Composition is again specialize form of Aggregation and we can call this as a "death" relationship.
It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object dose not have their lifecycle and if parent object
deletes all child object will also be deleted. Let's take again an example of relationship between
House and rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room
can not belongs to two different house if we delete the house room will automatically delete.
