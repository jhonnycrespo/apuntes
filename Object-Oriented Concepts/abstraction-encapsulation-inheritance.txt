Abstraction
============
 - is the process of moving from a specific idea to a more general one, thereby reducing complexity to improve comprehension.
 - ejm:
	-  For example, take a look at your mouse. Is it wireless? What kind of sensors does it have? How many buttons? 
	   Is it ergonomic? How big is it? The answers to all of these questions can precisely describe your mouse, 
	   but regardless of what the answers are, it's still a mouse, because it's a pointing device with buttons

	- That's all it takes to be a mouse. "Silver Logitech MX518" is a concrete, specific item, and "mouse" is an abstraction of that.

	- An important thing to think about is that there's no such concrete object as a "mouse", it's just an idea. 
	  The mouse on your desk is always something more specific - it's an Apple Magic Mouse or a Dell Optical Mouse or a 
	  Microsoft IntelliMouse - "mouse" is just an abstract concept.

One point of confusion regarding abstraction is its use as both a process and an entity.

Abstraction, as a process, denotes the extracting of the essential details about an item, or a group
of items, while ignoring the inessential details. Abstraction, as an entity,  denotes a model, a
view, or some other focused representation for an actual item. Abstraction is most often used as a
complexity mastering technique. For example, we often hear people say such things as: "just give me
the highlights" or "just the facts, please." What these people are asking for are abstractions.

We can have varying degrees of abstraction, although these "degrees" are more commonly referred to
as "levels." As we move to higher levels of abstraction, we focus on the larger and more important
pieces of information (using our chosen selection criteria). Another common observation is that as
we move to higher levels of abstraction, we tend to concern ourselves with progressively smaller
volumes of information, and fewer overall items. As we move to lower levels of abstraction, we
reveal more detail, typically encounter more individual items, and increase the volume of
information with which we must deal.

Abstraction is a modeling term
Encapsulation is a real implementation


In java you can use interfaces and abstract classes to achieve abstraction.
