Como decides (que criterio es mas importante) en que forma programar algo??



The fundamental theorem of readability
=======================================

KEY IDEA: code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to understand it.

Is Smaller always better?
==========================
generally speaking, the less code you write to solve a problem, the better.

but fewer lines isn't always better!!

So even though having fewer lines of code is a good goal, minimizing the time-till-understanding is an even better goal.

Does Time-Till-Understanding conflict with other goals
========================================================
You might be thinking, what about other constraints, like making code efficiont, or well-architected, or easy to test,
and so on? Don't these sometimes conflict with wanting to make code easy to understand?

We have found that these other goals don't interfere much at all. Even in the realm of highly optimized code, there are
still ways to make it highly readable as well. And making your code easy to understand often leads to code that is well
architected and easy to test.

Remember, the fundamental theorem of readibility trumps any other rule of principle in this book.
