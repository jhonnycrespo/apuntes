INTRODUCTION
=============

React is an open source library for building user interfaces. It lets you create views easily while making sure your UI
stays in sync with the underlying data mode.

	- React follows component oriented development. The general idea is to break your whole UI into a set of 
	  components.
	- React relies on unidirectional data flow.
