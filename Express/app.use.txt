app.use function
==================

app.use([path,] function [, function])

- mounts the specified middleware function or functions at the specified path.
- if path is not specified, it defaults to '/'.
- A route will match any path that follows its path inmediately with a '/'.
	ejm: app.use('/apple', ...) will match '/apple', 'apple/images', and so on


- Mounting a middleware function at a path will cause the middleware function to be executed 
  whenever the base of the requested path matches the path.
- Since path defaults to “/”, middleware mounted without a path will be executed for every request to the app.
- Middleware functions are executed sequentially, therefore the order of middleware inclusion is important.

* important: a router is a valid middleware.
	var router = express.Router();
	router.get('/', function(req, res, next){});
	app.use(router);

* An Express app is a valid middleware
	var subApp = express();
	subApp.get('/', function(req, res, next){});
	app.use(subApp);
