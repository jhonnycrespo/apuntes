Middleware is a subset of chained functions called by the Express.js routing layer before the user-defined
handler in invoked.

Here are the basic rules that apply to the middleware chain:
	- A middleware function always has the following signature: function (req, res, next)
	- Middleware functions are executed in the exact order in which they have been added to the application
	  chain.
	- Middleware functions use their third parameter "next" as a function to indicate that they have completed
	  their work and to exit.
