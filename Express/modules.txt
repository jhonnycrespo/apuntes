MODULES
=======
   - Node.js has a simple module loading system.

	- the content of foo.js:
		const circle = require('./circle.js');
		console.log('the area of a circle of radius 4 is ${circle.area(4)}');

	- the content of circle.js:
		const PI = Math.PI;
		exports.area = (r) => PI*r*r

   - If you want the root of your module's export to be a function(such as constructor) or if you want to export
     a complete object in one assignment instead of building it obe property at a time, assing it to "module.exports"
     instead of "exports".
