Nested Views
============
   States can be nested within each other. there are several ways of nesting states:
	- using 'dot notation'. for example .state('contacts.lists', {})
	- using the 'parent' property with the parent name as string. for example: parents: 'contacs'
	- using the 'parents' property with the parent object. For example parent: contacs (where contacs)
	  is a stateObjects.

WHAT DO CHILD STATES INHERIT FROM PARENT STATES
================================================
	- resolved dependencies viaa 'resolve'
	- custom 'data' properties
	- nothing else is inherited (no controllers, templates, urls, etc).However, children of abstract states
	  do inherit the 'url' property of their parents as a prefix of their own 'url'.
