WEB STORAGE
===========
    The Web Storage API provides mechanisms by which browsers can store key/value pairs, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies.

    The two mechanisms within Web Storage are as follows:

    * sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session (as long as the browser is open, including page reloads and restores)

    * localStorage does the same thing, but persists even when the browser is closed and reopened.
