The disabled and readonly attributes have similar effects — in fact, they look the same from the user's 
perspective. In both cases, what the user sees is a field that is slightly "grayed out", 
which cannot be clicked on or edited.

disabled
=========
 - If a field is disabled, the value of the field is not sent to the server when the form is submitted

readonly
=========
 - If a field is readonly, the value is sent to the server.


support
=======
 - disabled is supported in all versions of chrome, firefox, IE, Safari, Opera and Edge
