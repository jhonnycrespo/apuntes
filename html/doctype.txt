<!DOCTYPE html>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case sensitive.
