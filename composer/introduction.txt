Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. it allows you to declare the libraries your project
depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

Dependency Management
======================
Composer is not a package manager in the same sense as Yum or Apt are. Yes, it deals with "packages" or libraries,
but it manages them on a per-project basis, installing them in a directory (e.g. "vendor") inside your project. By default
it does not install anything globally. This, it is a dependency manager. It does however support a "global" project
for convenience via the global command.

Composer is strongly inspired by node's npm and ruby's bundler.
