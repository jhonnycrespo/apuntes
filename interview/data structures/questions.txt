* Difference between trees and graphs?

A Tree is just a restricted form of a Graph.

Trees have direction (parent / child relationships) and don't contain cycles.

Graph can have loops, circuits as well as can have self-loops.

In tree there is exactly one root node and every child have only one parent.

In graph there is no such concept of root node.

Graph is traversed by DFS: Depth First Search and in BFS : Breadth First Search algorithm

Tree is traversed in Pre-Order, In-Order and Post-Order (all three in DFS or in BFS algorithm)

Different types of trees are : Binary Tree , Binary Search Tree, AVL tree, Heaps.

Tree applications : sorting and searching like Tree Traversal & Binary Search.

There are mainly two types of Graphs : Directed and Undirected graphs.

Tree is a hierarchical model.

Graph is a network model.
