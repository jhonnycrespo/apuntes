AUTHENTICATE

	- 'req.user' contains the authenticated user.


LOGOUT

	- Passport exposes a logout() function on req (also aliased as logOut()) that can be called 
	  from any route handler which needs to terminate a login session. Invoking logout() will remove 
	  the req.user property and clear the login session (if any).
